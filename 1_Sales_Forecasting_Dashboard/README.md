## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to predict future sales accurately, leading to inventory inefficiencies and revenue loss.

## Solution
A time-series forecasting system was built using **Prophet** to predict store-level sales and visualize insights using Power BI.

## Business Insights & Recommendations

### 1) Sales Trend & Forecast
- Sales exhibit strong seasonality with peaks during holidays and promotions.
- Forecast shows a stable upward trend with higher volatility during peak periods.
- Confidence intervals highlight uncertainty windows for better planning.

### 2) Holiday Impact
- Holiday sales consistently outperform non-holiday periods.
- Holiday Impact KPI quantifies sales uplift.
- Not all holidays perform equally, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

### 3) Promotion Effectiveness
- Promotions significantly contribute to revenue.
- Some promotions show diminishing returns, indicating optimization opportunities.

### 4) Store & Store-Type Performance
- Certain store types outperform others consistently.
- Underperforming stores may require localized strategies.

### 5) Seasonality & Demand Patterns
- Monthly patterns reveal peak and low-demand seasons.
- Low-demand periods offer opportunities for inventory optimization.

## Business Recommendations
- Increase inventory before forecasted peak periods.
- Focus promotions on high-impact seasons and holidays.
- Use confidence intervals for risk-aware planning.
- Allocate resources based on store and store-type performance.
